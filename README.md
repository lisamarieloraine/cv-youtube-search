# YouTube Project

## Searching YouTube videos using image recognition.

The idea of this project was to make YouTube searches easier and more 
efficient for its users by adding a tool to search videos based on a picture. 
This way, a user who wants to find a YouTube video containing an object that is 
in his or her environment can simply take a picture using his smartphone camera 
and immediately obtain the results without having to type any text. 

The evaluation document of our project can be found in the root of this repository
and is called `evaluation-group01.pdf`. Moreover, the extensive project report is called
`report-group01.pdf`.
